Blockchain Image Storage README

Overview:
This README provides a brief introduction to our decentralized image storing application built on blockchain technology.

Description:
Our application leverages blockchain technology to provide a decentralized and immutable image storage solution. Images uploaded to the platform are securely stored across a distributed network of nodes, ensuring data integrity and availability.

Features:

Decentralized Storage: Images are stored across multiple nodes in the blockchain network, eliminating the need for a central server.
Immutable Records: Once uploaded, images cannot be altered or deleted, ensuring data integrity.
Transparent Transactions: All image uploads and transactions are recorded on the blockchain, providing transparency and accountability.
Access Control: Users have full control over their images and can manage access permissions as desired.
Cryptographic Security: Images are encrypted and stored using cryptographic techniques, ensuring data security.
How to Use:

Upload Image: Users can upload images to the platform using the provided interface.
View Images: Uploaded images can be viewed and accessed from any device connected to the blockchain network.
Manage Access: Users can manage access permissions for their images, controlling who can view or interact with them.
Transaction History: Users can view the transaction history associated with each image, providing transparency into its lifecycle.
Installation:

Clone the repository from GitHub.
Install the necessary dependencies using npm or yarn.
Run the application locally or deploy it to a blockchain network.
